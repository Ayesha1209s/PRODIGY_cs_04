⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only.

This project demonstrates a basic keylogger script built using Python and the pynput library. The script captures keyboard input and logs the keys pressed into a local file (keylog.txt). It was created solely to understand how keystroke logging works in cybersecurity, particularly in ethical hacking and penetration testing environments. This tool must not be used to monitor, collect, or exploit anyone’s personal information without their clear consent. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. The goal of this project is to enhance cybersecurity awareness by showing how easily such tools can be developed — and therefore, why protecting against them is crucial. The developer of this project does not condone or promote any form of malicious activity. Please use this code only in safe, ethical, and lawful contexts, such as in sandbox environments or personal research.
